requires user input

1. something like mouseActionListener() required
2. create 3 objects: rock, paper, scissors
3. have console log go to webpage display
4. while loop needed or use the "waiting for input" in its place

const x = new X();
const y = new Y();
const z = new Z();

const data = document.getElementById("rock");

//will the actionlistener be in the html doc or js?
//can data be put in equivalent conditions?

let m = mouseAction();

if m == x  //here I will have to have the mouseAction output to be able to be equivalent to the object(s)
